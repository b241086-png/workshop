    <h2>About Goa</h2>
    <p>Goa is a coastal state in western India known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife, Portuguese heritage, and delicious seafood. It's a perfect destination for both relaxation and adventure.
     is a state on the southwestern coast of India within the Konkan region, geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.It is bordered by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming its western coastline. It is India's smallest state by area and fourth-smallest by population.Panaji (also known as Panjim) is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city by population. The state's official language, spoken by the majority of its inhabitants, is Konkani.

The Portuguese, who first voyaged to the subcontinent in the early 16th century as merchants, conquered it shortly thereafter. Goa became an overseas territory of the Portuguese Empire and part of what was then known as Portuguese India, remaining under Portuguese rule for approximately 451 years until its annexation by India in December 1961. The historic city of Margão or "Madgaon" still reflects the cultural legacy of colonisation.</p><br>
